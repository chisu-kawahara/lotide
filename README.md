# Lotide

Lotide is a utility library built in JavaScript, offering a collection of functions to simplify common programming tasks, particularly around arrays, objects, and strings. It mimics some of the core functionality of the Lodash library but is implemented from scratch to demonstrate foundational JavaScript concepts.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs.

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @chisukawahara/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@chisukawahara/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`
